    <section>
      <title>Socialization</title>
        <p>Cerberus is a highly social and affectionate dog who bonds well with humans, especially children between the ages of 5 and 8. He may occasionally exhibit light herding behavior, gently guiding them around the home, which is typical for working breeds. His affectionate nature includes giving hugs on command and seeking physical closeness with trusted people. While he doesn’t jump up, he’s still learning personal space and needs further training.</p>
        <p>Cerberus wakes early—typically at 6 a.m.—and follows a predictable morning routine of a potty break, breakfast at 7 a.m., and a bowel movement shortly afterward. He does not do well when left alone for long periods and dislikes confinement in a crate. Instead, he thrives when integrated into a social environment, whether that's a multi-dog household or regular attendance at a daycare. He has successfully participated in daycare programs before and benefits greatly from this kind of pack-oriented engagement.</p>
        <note type="restriction">Cerberus is not suitable for homes with cats.</note>
